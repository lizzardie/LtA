        <!-- 
        so first gotta download all the maps
         then organize with world maps first, then maps grouped by the specific region they're in
            the above might require making another div, depending on how many world maps there are
            i want the smaller scale ones to be scrollable,
            
            maybe its actually world maps on the scrollable (r there enough to need? might end up static anyways)
            and then click on an area to be sent to a page of deatils of the region?? don't wanna 
            be redundant on the world anvil, so figure out what can be Added not Repeated
